# Devices are all tty devices that provide a connection to a smart meter.
# You may simply use the devices in /dev/*, like /dev/ttyUSB0, but this name may change after reboot
# By using the folder /dev/serial/by-id/* you are more likely to have a unique name that wont change
#[devices is expected to be a list object. Use dashes '- /device/name' for each entry]
devices:
- device: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_XXXX-if00-port0
  baudrate: 9600
- device: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_XXXXXXXX-if00-port0
  baudrate: 9600

# In case you have multiple meters (e.g. One dedicated for your heating system),
# you can define an alias for the meter. The name will replace the 'Device Identification Number' OBIS 0.0.9
#[meterNames is expected to be a dict object. Use colonss ' id: alias' for each entry]
meterNames:
  0123456789abcdef0123: Waermepumpe
  abcdef0123456789abcd: Normalstrom

#Define the codes which you want to see in the servers output
#Examples:
# 0.0.9 is the unique ID
# 1.8.0 is the total consumption
# 1.8.1 is the consumption of tariff 1 (if available)
# 1.8.2 is the consumption of tariff 2 (if available)
# 16.7.0 is the current active power

#Define host and port for the server to listen to
#Examples:
# host: 127.0.0.1, port: 80 -- The server will only listen to local connections on port 80
